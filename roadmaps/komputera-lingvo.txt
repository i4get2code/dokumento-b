=============
rule of thumb
=============

functional languages need to have higher kined types (hkt)
synergy
whitespace sensitive imperative (wssi)
whitespace sensitive functional (wssf)
mobile
best low-level (ll)
transpiler
low-high
iot
null-safety
metaprogramming

;; hkt examples
scala, haskell, idris, purescript

;; synergy examples:
scala -> jvm, javascript | c <- scala-native
nim -> c, c++, objective-c, javascript
scala-native haskell
kotlin-native haskell

;; wssi examples:
python nim | lobster || coffescript

;; wssf examples:
idris purescript | livescript elm

;; mobile examples:
scala kotlin | python idris || lux clojure haxe

;; ll examples:
nim

;; transpiler examples:
nim idris | purescript || lux haxe

;; low-high means that the language is convenient as dynamically-typed languages are
;; low-high examples:
nim | scala kotlin || red julia 

;; iot examples:
nim python

;; null-safe examples:
scala | kotlin idris || erlang julia elixir ceylon

;; metaprogramming examples:
nim | elixir julia lisp red

;; homoiconic languages have a few fatal flows (imho)
;; difficult to read and understand because of extreme simplicity.
;; simplicity that is hard despite uniform, minimal and logical syntax.
;; or maybe because of that.
;; the living proof that easy and simple are not the same
;; maybe vulnerable to injection
;; homoiconic examples:
any lisp, any rebol, julia

;; VERY IMPORTANT
;; think very carefully if you are willing to write code in this language

;; i have near perfect list now
