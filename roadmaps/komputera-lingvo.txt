rule of thumb
=============

synergy
whitespace sensitive imperative (wssi)
whitespace sensitive functional (wssf)
mobile
best low-level (ll)
transpiler
low-high
iot
null-safety
metaprogramming

;; either pure functional (fp) or
;; not primarily functional (nfp)
;; nfp examples:
scala, kotlin, nim, python
;; fp examples
idris, purescript

;; synergy examples:
nim python scala purescript
scala -> jvm, javascript | c <- scala-native
nim -> c, c++, objective-c, javascript

;; wssi examples:
python nim | lobster || coffescript

;; wssf examples:
idris purescript | livescript elm

;; mobile examples:
idris scala kotlin | python || lux clojure haxe

;; ll examples:
nim

;; transpiler examples:
nim idris | purescript || lux haxe

;; low-high means that the language is convenient as dynamically-typed languages are
;; low-high examples:
nim | scala kotlin || red julia 

;; iot examples:
nim python

;; null-safe examples:
idris scala | kotlin || erlang julia elixir ceylon

;; metaprogramming examples:
nim | elixir julia lisp red

==

;; homoiconic languages are unreadable
;; and only suited for ir
;; examples:
malfunction, lux
;; contra-examples:
hy/lang, spry, min, clojure
red, lux, scheme, common lisp, julia

;; VERY IMPORTANT
;; think very carefully if you are willing to write code in this language

;; i have near perfect list now
;; it's in near perfect order
