=============
rule of thumb
=============

functional languages need to have higher kined types (hkt)
synergy
whitespace sensitive imperative (wssi)
whitespace sensitive functional (wssf)
mobile
best low-level (ll)
transpiler
low-high
iot
null-safety
metaprogramming

;; hkt examples
scala, haskell, idris, purescript

;; synergy examples:
scala-native haskell rust kotlin-native
haskell idris purescript
scala kotlin java
;;
scala -> jvm javascript | c <- scala-native
rust == gluon dyon -> c 
scala-native == kotlin-native == nim
nim -> c c++ objective-c javascript

;; wssi examples:
nim python | lobster moonscript || coffescript

;; wssf examples:
haskell idris purescript | livescript || elm

;; mobile examples:
scala kotlin | idris python || lux clojure haxe

;; ll examples:
rust | nim || dlang

;; transpiler examples:
idris | purescript || nim ||| lux haxe

;; low-high means that the language is convenient as dynamically-typed languages are
;; low-high examples:
scala kotlin | nim || red julia 

;; iot examples:
rust python | nim

;; null-safe examples:
scala rust | kotlin idris || ceylon julia erlang elixir

;; metaprogramming examples:
nim | elixir julia lisp redbol

==/

;; homoiconic languages have a few fatal flows (imho)
;; difficult to read and understand because of extreme simplicity.
;; simplicity that is hard despite uniform, minimal and logical syntax.
;; or maybe because of that.
;; the living proof that easy and simple are not the same
;; maybe vulnerable to injection
;; homoiconic examples:
any lisp, redbol, julia

;; VERY IMPORTANT
;; think very carefully if you are willing to write code in this language

;; i have near perfect list now
;; it's in near perfect order
